select * from (slect empno,ename,sal rownum rn from employee order by rn)
where mod (rn,2)<>0;
#even
select * from (slect empno,ename,sal rownum rn from employee order by rn)
where mod (rn,2)=0;


#Question 4: Find the duplicated value and frequency in column
select count(dep_id),ename from department group by dep_id  having count(dep_id)>2;
slect ename,count(*) from emp group by ename having count(*)>=2;
